ASIM:


can be used for SaaS onboarding, or A/B testing
oh btw by the end we will also have to deploy our project
as website
but in demo we should make another dummy website
other than mvp we can also say that we will first detect the websites frontend and then store the frontend code and then we give them a potentially better website ui
like just add a button for this feature but wont work
